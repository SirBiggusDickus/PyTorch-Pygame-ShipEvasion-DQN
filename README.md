# PyTorch-Pygame-ShipEvasion-DQN
this project can be used as template for setting up a Pytorch Deep Q Network agent possibly inside a Pygame enviorement. Remember to contact the developers of these Open Library's if you start selling products that include Open Scource Library's. this was an Educational Project.

it includes 2 programs. one Pygame that looks like this; ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fd6f6035-bd56-45a1-a91b-0a308f6fe208) which (slowly) trains the agent, and one seperate program that includes semi-realistic ship simulation using Pygame aswell. i never managed to combine the two together within the available time of the project.

feel free to look around. use it as a template for learning Pygame and/or Pytorch.

Disclaimer;
the code is far from perfect. it should work to some extent though.
