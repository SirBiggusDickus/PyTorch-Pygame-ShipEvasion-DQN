# PyTorch-Pygame-ShipEvasion-DQN
this project can be used as template for setting up a Pytorch Deep Q Network agent possibly inside a Pygame enviorement.

it includes 2 programs. one Pygame that looks like this;

which (slowly) trains the agent, and one seperate program that includes semi-realistic ship simulation using Pygame. I never managed to combine the two together within the available time of the project.
feel free to look around. Use it as a template for learning Pygame https://www.pygame.org/docs/ and/or Pytorch https://pytorch.org/ .

If you'r interested in the research, the zip includes a powerpoint and paper from the project which attempts to explain the story of the project.
